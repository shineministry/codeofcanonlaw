<h2>BOOK I. GENERAL NORMS</h2>
<h2>Canon 1</h2>
<p>The canons of this Code regard only the Latin Church.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-2">
<h2>Canon 2</h2>
<p>For the most part the Code does not define the rites which must be observed in celebrating liturgical actions. Therefore, liturgical laws in force until now retain their force unless one of them is contrary to the canons of the Code.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-3">
<h2>Canon 3</h2>
<p>The canons of the Code neither abrogate nor derogate from the agreements entered into by the Apostolic See with nations or other political societies. These agreements therefore continue in force exactly as at present, notwithstanding contrary prescripts of this Code.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-4">
<h2>Canon 4</h2>
<p>Acquired rights and privileges granted to physical or juridic persons up to this time by the Apostolic See remain intact if they are in use and have not been revoked, unless the canons of this Code expressly revoke them.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-5">
<h2>Canon 5</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Universal or particular customs presently in force which are contrary to the prescripts of these canons and are reprobated by the canons of this Code are absolutely suppressed and are not permitted to revive in the future. Other contrary customs are also considered suppressed unless the Code expressly provides otherwise or unless they are centenary or immemorial customs which can be tolerated if, in the judgment of the ordinary, they cannot be removed due to the circumstances of places and persons.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Universal or particular customs beyond the law (*praeter ius*) which are in force until now are preserved.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-6">
<h2>Canon 6</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> When this Code takes force, the following are abrogated:

1. the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917;

2. other universal or particular laws contrary to the prescripts of this Code unless other provision is expressly made for particular laws;

3. any universal or particular penal laws whatsoever issued by the Apostolic See unless they are contained in this Code;

4. other universal disciplinary laws regarding matter which this Code completely reorders.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Insofar as they repeat former law, the canons of this Code must be assessed also in accord with canonical tradition.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-7">
<h2>Canon 7</h2>
<p>A law is established when it is promulgated.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-8">
<h2>Canon 8</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Universal ecclesiastical laws are promulgated by publication in the official commentary, Acta Apostolicae Sedis, unless another manner of promulgation has been prescribed in particular cases. They take force only after three months have elapsed from the date of that issue of the Acta unless they bind immediately from the very nature of the matter, or the law itself has specifically and expressly established a shorter or longer suspensive period (*vacatio*).</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Particular laws are promulgated in the manner determined by the legislator and begin to oblige a month after the day of promulgation unless the law itself establishes another time period.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-9">
<h2>Canon 9</h2>
<p>Laws regard the future, not the past, unless they expressly provide for the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-10">
<h2>Canon 10</h2>
<p>Only those laws must be considered invalidating or disqualifying which expressly establish that an act is null or that a person is effected.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-11">
<h2>Canon 11</h2>
<p>Merely ecclesiastical laws bind those who have been baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it, possess the efficient use of reason, and, unless the law expressly provides otherwise, have completed seven years of age.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-12">
<h2>Canon 12</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Universal laws bind everywhere all those for whom they were issued.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> All who are actually present in a certain territory, however, are exempted from universal laws which are not in force in that territory.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> Laws established for a particular territory bind those for whom they were issued as well as those who have a domicile or quasi-domicile there and who at the same time are actually residing there, without prejudice to the prescript of  can. 13.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-13">
<h2>Canon 13</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Particular laws are not presumed to be personal but territorial unless it is otherwise evident.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Travelers are not bound:

1. by the particular laws of their own territory as long as they are absent from it unless either the transgression of those laws causes harm in their own territory or the laws are personal;

2. by the laws of the territory in which they are present, with the exception of those laws which provide for public order, which determine the formalities of acts, or which regard immovable goods located in the territory.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> Transients are bound by both universal and particular laws which are in force in the place where they are present.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-14">
<h2>Canon 14</h2>
<p>Laws, even invalidating and disqualifying ones, do not oblige when there is a doubt about the law. When there is a doubt about a fact, however, ordinaries can dispense from laws provided that, if it concerns a reserved dispensation, the authority to whom it is reserved usually grants it.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-15">
<h2>Canon 15</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Ignorance or error about invalidating or disqualifying laws does not impede their effect unless it is expressly established otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Ignorance or error about a law, a penalty, a fact concerning oneself, or a notorious fact concerning another is not presumed; it is presumed about a fact concerning another which is not notorious until the contrary is proven.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-16">
<h2>Canon 16</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The legislator authentically interprets laws as does the one to whom the same legislator has entrusted the power of authentically interpreting.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> An authentic interpretation put forth in the form of law has the same force as the law itself and must be promulgated. If it only declares the words of the law which are certain in themselves, it is retroactive; if it restricts or extends the law, or if it explains a doubtful law, it is not retroactive.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> An interpretation in the form of a judicial sentence or of an administrative act in a particular matter, however, does not have the force of law and only binds the persons for whom and affects the matters for which it was given.</p>
</div>

1. that common, divisible, patrimonial goods and rights as well as debts and other obligations are divided among the juridic persons concerned, with due proportion in equity and justice, after all the circumstances and needs of each have been taken into account;

2. that the use and usufruct of common goods which are not divisible accrue to each juridic person and that the obligations proper to them are imposed upon each, in due proportion determined in equity and justice.</p>

1. if consent is required, the act of a superior who does not seek the consent of those persons or who acts contrary to the opinion of all or any of them is invalid;

2. if counsel is required, the act of a superior who does not hear those persons is invalid; although not obliged to accept their opinion even if unanimous, a superior is nonetheless not to act contrary to that opinion, especially if unanimous, without a reason which is overriding in the superiors judgment.</p>

2. the major superior is to warn the member in writing or before two witnesses with an explicit threat of subsequent dismissal unless the member reforms, with the cause for dismissal clearly indicated and full opportunity for self-defense given to the member; if the warning occurs in vain, however, the superior is to proceed to another warning after an intervening space of at least fifteen days;

<h2>BOOK III. THE TEACHING FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2>Canon 747</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The Church, to which Christ the Lord has entrusted the deposit of faith so that with the assistance of the Holy Spirit it might protect the revealed truth reverently, examine it more closely, and proclaim and expound it faithfully, has the duty and innate right, independent of any human power whatsoever, to preach the gospel to all peoples, also using the means of social communication proper to it.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> It belongs to the Church always and everywhere to announce moral principles, even about the social order, and to render judgment concerning any human affairs insofar as the fundamental rights of the human person or the salvation of souls requires it.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-748">
<h2>Canon 748</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> All persons are bound to seek the truth in those things which regard God and his Church and by virtue of divine law are bound by the obligation and possess the right of embracing and observing the truth which they have come to know.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> No one is ever permitted to coerce persons to embrace the Catholic faith against their conscience.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-749">
<h2>Canon 749</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> By virtue of his office, the Supreme Pontiff possesses infallibility in teaching when as the supreme pastor and teacher of all the Christian faithful, who strengthens his brothers and sisters in the faith, he proclaims by definitive act that a doctrine of faith or morals is to be held.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The college of bishops also possesses infallibility in teaching when the bishops gathered together in an ecumenical council exercise the magisterium as teachers and judges of faith and morals who declare for the universal Church that a doctrine of faith or morals is to be held definitively; or when dispersed throughout the world but preserving the bond of communion among themselves and with the successor of Peter and teaching authentically together with the Roman Pontiff matters of faith or morals, they agree that a particular proposition is to be held definitively.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> No doctrine is understood as defined infallibly unless this is manifestly evident.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-750">
<h2>Canon 750</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> A person must believe with divine and Catholic faith all those things contained in the word of God, written or handed on, that is, in the one deposit of faith entrusted to the Church, and at the same time proposed as divinely revealed either by the solemn magisterium of the Church or by its ordinary and universal magisterium which is manifested by the common adherence of the Christian faithful under the leadership of the sacred magisterium; therefore all are bound to avoid any doctrines whatsoever contrary to them.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Each and every thing which is proposed definitively by the magisterium of the Church concerning the doctrine of faith and morals, that is, each and every thing which is required to safeguard reverently and to expound faithfully the same deposit of faith, is also to be firm-ly embraced and retained; therefore, one who rejects those propositions which are to be held definitively is opposed to the doctrine of the Catholic Church.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-751">
<h2>Canon 751</h2>
<p>Heresy is the obstinate denial or obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be believed by divine and Catholic faith; apostasy is the total repudiation of the Christian faith; schism is the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-752">
<h2>Canon 752</h2>
<p>Although not an assent of faith, a religious submission of the intellect and will must be given to a doctrine which the Supreme Pontiff or the college of bishops declares concerning faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim it by definitive act; therefore, the Christian faithful are to take care to avoid those things which do not agree with it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Canon 753</h2>
<p>Although the bishops who are in communion with the head and members of the college, whether individually or joined together in conferences of bishops or in particular councils, do not possess infallibility in teaching, they are authentic teachers and instructors of the faith for the Christian faithful entrusted to their care; the Christian faithful are bound to adhere with religious submission of mind to the authentic magisterium of their bishops.</p>

<h2>BOOK IV. FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH (Cann. 834 - 848)</h2>
<h2>Canon 834</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The Church fulfills its sanctifying function in a particular way through the sacred liturgy, which is an exercise of the priestly function of Jesus Christ. In the sacred liturgy the sanctification of humanity is signified through sensible signs and effected in a manner proper to each sign. In the sacred liturgy, the whole public worship of God is carried out by the Head and members of the mystical Body of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Such worship takes place when it is carried out in the name of the Church by persons legitimately designated and through acts approved by the authority of the Church.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-835">
<h2>Canon 835</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The bishops in the first place exercise the sanctifying function; they are the high priests, the principal dispensers of the mysteries of God, and the directors, promoters, and guardians of the entire liturgical life in the church entrusted to them.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Presbyters also exercise this function; sharing in the priesthood of Christ and as his ministers under the authority of the bishop, they are consecrated to celebrate divine worship and to sanctify the people.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> Deacons have a part in the celebration of divine worship according to the norm of the prescripts of the law.</p>
<p><strong>Â§4.</strong> The other members of the Christian faithful also have their own part in the function of sanctifying by participating actively in their own way in liturgical celebrations, especially the Eucharist. Parents share in a particular way in this function by leading a conjugal life in a Christian spirit and by seeing to the Christian education of their children.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-836">
<h2>Canon 836</h2>
<p>Since Christian worship, in which the common priesthood of the Christian faithful is carried out, is a work which proceeds from faith and is based on it, sacred ministers are to take care to arouse and enlighten this faith diligently, especially through the ministry of the word, which gives birth to and nourishes the faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-837">
<h2>Canon 837</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Liturgical actions are not private actions but celebrations of the Church itself which is the sacrament of unity, that is, a holy people gathered and ordered under the bishops. Liturgical actions therefore belong to the whole body of the Church and manifest and affect it; they touch its individual members in different ways, however, according to the diversity of orders, functions, and actual participation.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Inasmuch as liturgical actions by their nature entail a common celebration, they are to be celebrated with the presence and active participation of the Christian faithful where possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-838">
<h2>Canon 838</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The direction of the sacred liturgy depends solely on the authority of the Church which resides in the Apostolic See and, according to the norm of law, the diocesan bishop.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> It is for the Apostolic See to order the sacred liturgy of the universal Church, publish liturgical books and review their translations in vernacular languages, and exercise vigilance that liturgical regulations are observed faithfully everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> It pertains to the conferences of bishops to prepare and publish, after the prior review of the Holy See, translations of liturgical books in vernacular languages, adapted appropriately within the limits defined in the liturgical books themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Â§4.</strong> Within the limits of his competence, it pertains to the diocesan bishop in the Church entrusted to him to issue liturgical norms which bind everyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-839">
<h2>Canon 839</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The Church carries out the function of sanctifying also by other means, both by prayers in which it asks God to sanctify the Christian faithful in truth, and by works of penance and charity which greatly help to root and strengthen the kingdom of Christ in souls and contribute to the salvation of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Local ordinaries are to take care that the prayers and pious and sacred exercises of the Christian people are fully in keeping with the norms of the Church.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-840">
<h2>Canon 840</h2>
<p>The sacraments of the New Testament were instituted by Christ the Lord and entrusted to the Church.

As actions of Christ and the Church, they are signs and means which express and strengthen the faith, render worship to God, and effect the sanctification of humanity and thus contribute in the greatest way to establish, strengthen, and manifest ecclesiastical communion. Accordingly, in the celebration of the sacraments the sacred ministers and the other members of the Christian faithful must use the greatest veneration and necessary diligence.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-841">
<h2>Canon 841</h2>
<p>Since the sacraments are the same for the whole Church and belong to the divine deposit, it is only for the supreme authority of the Church to approve or define the requirements for their validity; it is for the same or another competent authority according to the norm of  can. 838 Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§3 and 4 to decide what pertains to their licit celebration, administration, and reception and to the order to be observed in their celebration.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-842">
<h2>Canon 842</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> A person who has not received baptism cannot be admitted validly to the other sacraments.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and the Most Holy Eucharist are interrelated in such a way that they are required for full Christian initiation.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-843">
<h2>Canon 843</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Sacred ministers cannot deny the sacraments to those who seek them at appropriate times, are properly disposed, and are not prohibited by law from receiving them.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Pastors of souls and other members of the Christian faithful, according to their respective ecclesiastical function, have the duty to take care that those who seek the sacraments are prepared to receive them by proper evangelization and catechetical instruction, attentive to the norms issued by competent authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-844">
<h2>Canon 844</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Catholic ministers administer the sacraments licitly to Catholic members of the Christian faithful alone, who likewise receive them licitly from Catholic ministers alone, without prejudice to the prescripts of Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§2, 3, and 4 of this canon, and  can. 861,Ã‚Â§2.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Whenever necessity requires it or true spiritual advantage suggests it, and provided that danger of error or of indifferentism is avoided, the Christian faithful for whom it is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister are permitted to receive the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick from non-

Catholic ministers in whose Churches these sacraments are valid.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> Catholic ministers administer the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick licitly to members of Eastern Churches which do not have full communion with the Catholic Church if they seek such on their own accord and are properly disposed. This is also valid for members of other Churches which in the judgment of the Apostolic See are in the same condition in regard to the sacraments as these Eastern Churches.</p>
<p><strong>Â§4.</strong> If the danger of death is present or if, in the judgment of the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops, some other grave necessity urges it, Catholic ministers administer these same sacraments licitly also to other Christians not having full communion with the Catholic Church, who cannot approach a minister of their own community and who seek such on their own accord, provided that they manifest Catholic faith in respect to these sacraments and are properly disposed.</p>
<p><strong>Â§5.</strong> For the cases mentioned in Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§2, 3, and 4, the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops is not to issue general norms except after consultation at least with the local competent authority of the interested non-Catholic Church or community.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-845">
<h2>Canon 845</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Since the sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and orders imprint a character, they cannot be repeated.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> If after completing a diligent inquiry a prudent doubt still exists whether the sacraments mentioned in Ã‚Â§1

were actually or validly conferred, they are to be conferred conditionally.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-846">
<h2>Canon 846</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> In celebrating the sacraments the liturgical books approved by competent authority are to be observed faithfully; accordingly, no one is to add, omit, or alter anything in them on ones own authority.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The minister is to celebrate the sacraments according to the ministers own rite.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-847">
<h2>Canon 847</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> In administering the sacraments in which holy oils must be used, the minister must use oils pressed from olives or other plants and, without prejudice to the prescript of  can. 999, n. 2, consecrated or blessed recently by a bishop; he is not to use old oils unless it is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The pastor is to obtain the holy oils from his own bishop and is to preserve them diligently with proper care.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-848">
<h2>Canon 848</h2>
<p>The minister is to seek nothing for the administration of the sacraments beyond the offerings defined by competent authority, always taking care that the needy are not deprived of the assistance of the sacraments because of poverty.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-849">
<h2>Canon 849</h2>
<p>Baptism, the gateway to the sacraments and necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire, is validly conferred only by a washing of true water with the proper form of words. Through baptism men and women are freed from sin, are reborn as children of God, and, configured to Christ by an indelible character, are incorporated into the Church.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-850">
<h2>Canon 850</h2>
<p>Baptism is administered according to the order prescribed in the approved liturgical books, except in case of urgent necessity when only those things required for the validity of the sacrament must be observed.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-851">
<h2>Canon 851</h2>
<p>The celebration of baptism must be prepared properly; consequently:

1. an adult who intends to receive baptism is to be admitted to the catechumenate and is to be led insofar as possible through the various stages to sacramental initiation, according to the order of initiation adapted by the conference of bishops and the special norms issued by it;

2. the parents of an infant to be baptized and those who are to undertake the function of sponsor are to be instructed properly on the meaning of this sacrament and the obligations attached to it. The pastor personally or through others is to take care that the parents are properly instructed through both pastoral advice and common prayer, bringing several families together and, where possible, visiting them.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-852">
<h2>Canon 852</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The prescripts of the canons on adult baptism are to be applied to all those who, no longer infants, have attained the use of reason.</p>

<p>In the sacrament of penance the faithful who confess their sins to a legitimate minister, are sorry for them, and intend to reform themselves obtain from God through the absolution imparted by the same minister forgiveness for the sins they have committed after baptism and, at the same, time are reconciled with the Church which they have wounded by sinning.</p>

<h2>Canon 960</h2>
<p>Individual and integral confession and absolution constitute the only ordinary means by which a member of the faithful conscious of grave sin is reconciled with God and the Church. Only physical or moral impossibility excuses from confession of this type; in such a case reconciliation can be obtained by other means.</p>

<h2>Canon 961</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Absolution cannot be imparted in a general manner to many penitents at once without previous individual confession unless:

1. danger of death is imminent and there is insufficient time for the priest or priests to hear the confessions of the individual penitents;

2. there is grave necessity, that is, when in view of the number of penitents, there are not enough confessors available to hear the confessions of individuals properly within a suitable period of time in such a way that the penitents are forced to be deprived for a long while of sacramental grace or holy communion through no fault of their own. Sufficient necessity is not considered to exist when confessors cannot be present due only to the large number of penitents such as can occur on some great feast or pilgrimage.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> It belongs to the diocesan bishop to judge whether the conditions required according to the norm of Ã‚Â§1, n. 2 are present. He can determine the cases of such necessity, attentive to the criteria agreed upon with the other members of the conference of bishops.</p>

<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Insofar as it can be done even on the occasion of the reception of general absolution, the Christian faithful are to be instructed about the requirements of the norm of Ã‚Â§1. An exhortation that each person take care to make an act of contrition is to precede general absolution even in the case of danger of death, if there is time.</p>

<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> With regard to Masses independently founded in legacies or in any other way, the diocesan bishop has the power, because of diminished revenues and for as long as the cause exists, to reduce the obligations to the level of offering legitimately established in the diocese, provided that there is no one obliged to increase the offering who can effectively be made to do so.</p>

<h2>BOOK VI. PENAL SANCTIONS IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2>Canon 1311</h2>
<p>The Church has the innate and proper right to coerce offending members of the Christian faithful with penal sanctions.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1312">
<h2>Canon 1312</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The following are penal sanctions in the Church:

1. medicinal penalties, or censures, which are listed in  cann. 1331-1333;

2. expiatory penalties mentioned in can. 1336.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The law can establish other expiatory penalties which deprive a member of the Christian faithful of some spiritual or temporal good and which are consistent with the supernatural purpose of the Church.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> Penal remedies and penances are also used; the former especially to prevent delicts, the latter to substitute for or to increase a penalty.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1313">
<h2>Canon 1313</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> If a law is changed after a delict has been committed, the law more favorable to the accused is to be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> If a later law abolishes a law or at least the penalty, the penalty immediately ceases.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1314">
<h2>Canon 1314</h2>
<p>Generally, a penalty is ferendae sententiae, so that it does not bind the guilty party until after it has been imposed; if the law or precept expressly establishes it, however, a penalty is latae sententiae, so that it is incurred ipso facto when the delict is committed.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1315">
<h2>Canon 1315</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> A person who has legislative power can also issue penal laws; within the limits of his competence by reason of territory or of persons, moreover, he can by his own laws also strengthen with an appropriate penalty a divine law or an ecclesiastical law issued by a higher authority.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The law itself can determine a penalty, or its determination can be left to the prudent appraisal of a judge.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> Particular law also can add other penalties to those established by universal law for some delict; however, this is not to be done except for very grave necessity. If universal law threatens an indeterminate or facultative penalty, particular law can also establish a determinate or obligatory one in its place.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1316">
<h2>Canon 1316</h2>
<p>Insofar as possible, diocesan bishops are to take care that if penal laws must be issued, they are uniform in the same city or region.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1317">
<h2>Canon 1317</h2>
<p>Penalties are to be established only insofar as they are truly necessary to provide more suitably for ecclesiastical discipline. Particular law, however, cannot establish a penalty of dismissal from the clerical state.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1318">
<h2>Canon 1318</h2>
<p>A legislator is not to threaten latae sententiae penalties except possibly for certain singularly malicious delicts which either can result in graver scandal or cannot be punished effectively by ferendae sententiae penalties; he is not, however, to establish censures, especially excommunication, except with the greatest moderation and only for graver delicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1319">
<h2>Canon 1319</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Insofar as a person can impose precepts in the external forum in virtue of the power of governance, the person can also threaten determinate penalties by precept, except perpetual expiatory penalties.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> A penal precept is not to be issued unless the matter has been considered thoroughly and those things established in cann. 1317 and  1318 about particular laws have been observed.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1320">
<h2>Canon 1320</h2>
<p>The local ordinary can coerce religious with penalties in all those matters in which they are subject to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1321">
<h2>Canon 1321</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> No one is punished unless the external violation of a law or precept, committed by the person, is gravely imputable by reason of malice or negligence.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> A penalty established by a law or precept binds the person who has deliberately violated the law or precept; however, a person who violated a law or precept by omitting necessary diligence is not punished unless the law or precept provides otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> When an external violation has occurred, imputability is presumed unless it is otherwise apparent.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1322">
<h2>Canon 1322</h2>
<p>Those who habitually lack the use of reason are considered to be incapable of a delict, even if they violated a law or precept while seemingly sane.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1323">
<h2>Canon 1323</h2>
<p>The following are not subject to a penalty when they have violated a law or precept:

1. a person who has not yet completed the sixteenth year of age;

2. a person who without negligence was ignorant that he or she violated a law or precept; inadvertence and error are equivalent to ignorance;

3. a person who acted due to physical force or a chance occurrence which the person could not foresee or, if foreseen, avoid;

4. a person who acted coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience unless the act is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls;

5. a person who acted with due moderation against an unjust aggressor for the sake of legitimate self defense or defense of another;

6. a person who lacked the use of reason, without prejudice to the prescripts of cann.  1324, Ã‚Â§1, n. 2 and  1325;

7. a person who without negligence thought that one of the circumstances mentioned in nn. 4 or 5 was present.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1324">
<h2>Canon 1324</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The perpetrator of a violation is not exempt from a penalty, but the penalty established by law or precept must be tempered or a penance employed in its place if the delict was committed:

1. by a person who had only the imperfect use of reason;

2. by a person who lacked the use of reason because of drunkenness or another similar culpable disturbance of mind;

3. from grave heat of passion which did not precede and hinder all deliberation of mind and consent of will and provided that the passion itself had not been stimulated or fostered voluntarily;

4. by a minor who has completed the age of sixteen years;

5. by a person who was coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience if the delict is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls;

6. by a person who acted without due moderation against an unjust aggressor for the sake of legitimate self defense or defense of another;

7. against someone who gravely and unjustly provokes the person;

8. by a person who thought in culpable error that one of the circumstances mentioned in  can. 1323, nn. 4 or 5 was present;

9. by a person who without negligence did not know that a penalty was attached to a law or precept;

10. by a person who acted without full imputability provided that the imputability was grave.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> A judge can act in the same manner if another circumstance is present which diminishes the gravity of a delict.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> In the circumstances mentioned in Ã‚Â§1, the accused is not bound by a latae sententiae penalty.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1325">
<h2>Canon 1325</h2>
<p>Crass, supine, or affected ignorance can never be considered in applying the prescripts of cann.  1323 and  1324; likewise drunkenness or other disturbances of mind cannot be considered if they are sought deliberately in order to commit or excuse a delict, nor can passion which is voluntarily stimulated or fostered.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1326">
<h2>Canon 1326</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> A judge can punish the following more gravely than the law or precept has established:

1. a person who after a condemnation or after the declaration of a penalty continues so to offend that from the circumstances the obstinate ill will of the person can prudently be inferred;

2. a person who has been established in some dignity or who has abused a position of authority or office in order to commit the delict;

3. an accused person who, when a penalty has been established against a delict based on negligence, foresaw the event and nonetheless omitted precautions to avoid it, which any diligent person would have employed.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> If the penalty established in the cases mentioned in Ã‚Â§1 is latae sententiae, another penalty or a penance can be added.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1327">
<h2>Canon 1327</h2>
<p>Particular law can establish other exempting, mitigating, or aggravating circumstances besides the cases in  cann. 1323-1326, either by general norm or for individual delicts. Likewise, circumstances can be established in a precept which exempt from, mitigate, or increase a penalty established by the precept.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1328">
<h2>Canon 1328</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> A person who has done or omitted something in order to commit a delict and yet, contrary to his or her intent, did not commit the delict is not bound by the penalty established for a completed delict unless the law or precept provides otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> If the acts or omissions are by their nature conducive to the execution of the delict, however, their perpetrator can be subjected to a penance or penal remedy unless the perpetrator voluntarily ceased from carrying out the delict which had been initiated. If scandal or some other grave damage or danger resulted, however, the perpetrator, even if he or she voluntarily desisted, can be punished with a just penalty, although one lesser than that established for a completed delict.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1329">
<h2>Canon 1329</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> If ferendae sententiae penalties are established for the principal perpetrator, those who conspire together to commit a delict and are not expressly named in a law or precept are subject to the same penalties or to others of the same or lesser gravity.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Accomplices who are not named in a law or precept incur a latae sententiae penalty attached to a delict if without their assistance the delict would not have been committed, and the penalty is of such a nature that it can affect them; otherwise, they can be punished by ferendae sententiae penalties.</p>

3. to exercise any ecclesiastical offices, ministries, or functions whatsoever or to place acts of governance.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> If the excommunication has been imposed or declared, the offender:

1. who wishes to act against the prescript of Ã‚Â§1, n. 1 must be prevented from doing so, or the liturgical action must be stopped unless a grave cause precludes this;

2. invalidly places acts of governance which are illicit according to the norm of Ã‚Â§1, n. 3;

<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> A law or precept can establish that a suspended person cannot place acts of governance validly after a condemnatory or declaratory sentence.</p>

1. the offices or the power of governance which are not under the power of the superior who establishes the penalty;

2. the right of residence which the offender may have by reason of office;

3. the right to administer goods which may pertain to the office of the person suspended if the penalty is latae sententiae.</p>

2. abstain from imposing a penalty, impose a lighter penalty, or employ a penance if the offender has reformed and repaired the scandal or if the offender has been or, it is foreseen, will be punished sufficiently by civil authority;

3. suspend the obligation of observing an expiatory penalty if it is the first offense of an offender who has lived a praiseworthy life and if the need to repair scandal is not pressing, but in such a way that if the offender commits an offense again within the time determined by the judge, the person is to pay the penalty due for each delict unless in the interim the time for the prescription of a penal action has elapsed for the first delict.</p>

<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The diocesan bishop is able to issue the declaration mentioned in Ã‚Â§1 only if, after having carried out appropriate investigations, he attains moral certitude of the death of the spouse from the depositions of witnesses, from rumor, or from evidence.

</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1733">
<h2>Canon 1733</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Whenever a person considers himself or herself aggrieved by a decree, it is particularly desirable that the person and the author of the decree avoid any contention and take care to seek an equitable solution by common counsel, possibly using the mediation and effort of wise persons to avoid or settle the controversy in a suitable way.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The conference of bishops can determine that each diocese establish in a stable manner an office or council whose function is to seek and suggest equitable solutions according to the norms determined by the conference. If the conference has not ordered this, however, the bishop can establish a council or office of this kind.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> The office or council mentioned in Ã‚Â§2 is especially to be of assistance when the revocation of a decree has been requested according to the norm of  can. 1734 and the time limits for making recourse have not elapsed. If recourse has been proposed against a decree, however, the superior who deals with the recourse is to urge the person making recourse and the author of the decree to seek a solution of this kind whenever he sees hope of a favorable outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1734">
<h2>Canon 1734</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> Before proposing recourse a person must seek the revocation or emendation of the decree in writing from its author. When this petition is proposed, by that very fact suspension of the execution of the decree is also understood to be requested.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The petition must be made within the peremptory period of ten useful days from the legitimate notification of the decree.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> The norms of Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§1 and 2 are not valid:

1. for recourse proposed to a bishop against decrees issued by authorities subject to him;

2. for recourse proposed against a decree which decides a hierarchical recourse unless the bishop gave the decision;

3. for recourse proposed according to the norm of cann.  57 and  1735.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1735">
<h2>Canon 1735</h2>
<p>If within thirty days after receiving the petition mentioned in  can. 1734 the author of the decree communicates a new decree by which he either emends the earlier one or decides that the petition must be rejected, the time limits for making recourse run from the notification of the new decree. If the author makes no decision within the thirty days, however, the time limits run from the thirtieth day.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1736">
<h2>Canon 1736</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> In those matters in which hierarchical recourse suspends the execution of a decree, the petition mentioned in  can. 1734 also has the same effect.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> In other cases, if the author of the decree has not decreed the suspension of execution within ten days after receiving the petition mentioned in  can. 1734, an interim suspension can be sought from his hierarchical superior who can decree a suspension only for grave reasons and always cautiously so that the salvation of souls suffers no harm.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> If the execution of the decree has been suspended according to the norm of Ã‚Â§2 and recourse is proposed afterwards, the person who must deal with the recourse according to the norm of can. 1737, Ã‚Â§3 is to decide whether the suspension must be confirmed or revoked.</p>
<p><strong>Â§4.</strong> If no recourse is proposed against the decree within the established time limit, the interim suspension of the execution given according to the norm of Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§1 or 2 ceases by that very fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1737">
<h2>Canon 1737</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> A person who claims to have been aggrieved by a decree can make recourse for any just reason to the hierarchical superior of the one who issued the decree. The recourse can be proposed before the author of the decree who must transmit it immediately to the competent hierarchical superior.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> Recourse must be proposed within the peremptory time limit of fifteen useful days which in the cases mentioned in can. 1734, Ã‚Â§3 run from the day on which the decree was communicated; in other cases, however, they run according to the norm of can. 1735.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> Nevertheless, even in cases in which recourse does not suspend the execution of the decree by the law itself and suspension has not been decreed according to the norm of  can. 1736,Ã‚Â§2, the superior can order the execution to be suspended for a grave cause, yet cautiously so that the salvation of souls suffers no harm.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1738">
<h2>Canon 1738</h2>
<p>The person making recourse always has the right to use an advocate or procurator, but useless delays are to be avoided; indeed, a legal representative is to be appointed ex officio if the person making recourse lacks one and the superior thinks it necessary. Nevertheless, the superior always can order the person making recourse to be present in order to be questioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1739">
<h2>Canon 1739</h2>
<p>The superior who deals with the recourse, as the case warrants, is permitted not only to confirm the decree or declare it invalid but also to rescind or revoke it or, if it seems more expedient to the superior, to emend, replace, or modify it.</p>

<div class="canon" id="canon-1740">
<h2>Canon 1740</h2>
<p>When the ministry of any pastor becomes harmful or at least ineffective for any cause, even through no grave personal negligence, the diocesan bishop can remove him from the parish.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1741">
<h2>Canon 1741</h2>
<p>The causes for which a pastor can be removed legitimately from his parish are especially the following:

1. a manner of acting which brings grave detriment or disturbance to ecclesiastical communion;

2. ineptitude or a permanent infirmity of mind or body which renders the pastor unable to fulfill his functions usefully;

3. loss of a good reputation among upright and responsible parishioners or an aversion to the pastor which it appears will not cease in a brief time;

4. grave neglect or violation of parochial duties which persists after a warning;

5. poor administration of temporal affairs with grave damage to the Church whenever another remedy to this harm cannot be found.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1742">
<h2>Canon 1742</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> If the instruction which was carried out has established the existence of one of the causes mentioned in can. 1740, the bishop is to discuss the matter with two pastors selected from the group established for this purpose in a stable manner by the presbyteral council at the proposal of the bishop. If the bishop then judges that removal must take place, he paternally is to persuade the pastor to resign within fifteen days, after having explained, for validity, the cause and arguments for the removal.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> The prescript of  can. 682,Ã‚Â§2 is to be observed for pastors who are members of a religious institute or a society of apostolic life.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1743">
<h2>Canon 1743</h2>
<p>A pastor can submit a resignation not only purely and simply but also conditionally, provided that the bishop can accept it legitimately and actually does accept it.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1744">
<h2>Canon 1744</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> If the pastor has not responded within the prescribed days, the bishop is to repeat the invitation and extend the useful time to respond.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> If the bishop establishes that the pastor received the second invitation but did not respond even though not prevented by any impediment, or if the pastor refuses to resign without giving any reasons, the bishop is to issue a decree of removal.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1745">
<h2>Canon 1745</h2>
<p>If the pastor opposes the cause given and its reasons and alleges reasons which seem insufficient to the bishop, the bishop, in order to act validly, is:

1. to invite the pastor to organize his objections in a written report after he has inspected the acts, and offer any proofs he has to the contrary;

2. when any necessary instruction is completed, to consider the matter together with the same pastors mentioned in can. 1742, Ã‚Â§1, unless others must be designated because those pastors are unavailable;

3. finally, to establish whether the pastor must be removed or not and promptly to issue a decree on the matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1746">
<h2>Canon 1746</h2>
<p>After the pastor has been removed, the bishop is to make provision either for an assignment to some other office, if he is suitable for this, or for a pension as the case warrants and circumstances permit.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1747">
<h2>Canon 1747</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> The removed pastor must refrain from exercising the function of pastor, vacate the rectory as soon as possible, and hand over everything belonging to the parish to the person to whom the bishop has entrusted the parish.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> If, however, the man is sick and cannot be transferred elsewhere from the rectory without inconvenience, the bishop is to leave him the use, even exclusive use, of the rectory while this necessity lasts.</p>
<p><strong>Â§3.</strong> While recourse against a decree of removal is pending, the bishop cannot appoint a new pastor, but is to provide a parochial administrator in the meantime.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1748">
<h2>Canon 1748</h2>
<p>If the good of souls or the necessity or advantage of the Church demands that a pastor be transferred from a parish which he is governing usefully to another parish or another office, the bishop is to propose the transfer to him in writing and persuade him to consent to it out of love of God and souls.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1749">
<h2>Canon 1749</h2>
<p>If the pastor does not intend to submit to the counsel and persuasions of the bishop, he is to explain the reasons in writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1750">
<h2>Canon 1750</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding the reasons alleged, if the bishop decides not to withdraw from his proposal, he is to consider the reasons which favor or oppose the transfer with two pastors selected according to the norm of  can. 1742, Ã‚Â§1. If he then decides to implement the transfer, however, he is to repeat the paternal exhortations to the pastor.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1751">
<h2>Canon 1751</h2>
<p><strong>Â§1.</strong> When this has been done, if the pastor still refuses and the bishop thinks that the transfer must be made, he is to issue a decree of transfer, establishing that the parish will be vacant after the lapse of a set time.</p>
<p><strong>Â§2.</strong> If this period of time has passed without action, he is to declare the parish vacant.</p>
</div>
<div class="canon" id="canon-1752">
<h2>Canon 1752</h2>
<p>In cases of transfer the prescripts of can. 1747 are to be applied, canonical equity is to be observed, and the salvation of souls, which must always be the supreme law in the Church, is to be kept before ones eyes.</p>
